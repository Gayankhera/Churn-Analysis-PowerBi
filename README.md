2. Demographic Insights
Churners are slightly more represented among younger (0–20 age) customers (49.76%) compared to their share in the overall database.

Senior citizens:

Proportionally, churners include many senior citizens (476 out of 1,869)—compare this to the general customer base (1,142 of 7,043).

3. Phone Service
Most churners had phone service (over 1,700 of 1,869 churners).

However, the proportion of customers without phone service is higher among churners (about 200) than among the overall base (about 70), indicating that customers who lack this service are much more likely to churn.

4. Contract Type
Monthly contracts dominate churners: 1,660 out of 1,869 (88.55%) churners are on monthly contracts, much higher than their overall share (1,700 of 7,043, or 24%). This is a strong signal that customers with less commitment are at greater churn risk.

Yearly and two-year contracts retain customers best.

5. Internet Service
Churners are more likely to have fiber optic internet (24.56%, 460 churners), which is a higher ratio than in the full customer group.

The 'No Internet' and 'DSL' segments are less prominent among churners.

6. Partner Status
Not having a partner is more common among churners (69% of churners have no partner, compared to 53% in the customer base), suggesting single customers may be at higher risk.

7. Tenure
Churners skew heavily toward shorter tenure bands—more than half have a tenure between 0–20 months—compared to staying customers who are distributed more broadly across the tenure spectrum.

This confirms that early-career customers are much more likely to churn.

8. Payment Method
Electronic check is the most common method among churners, which may imply a correlation between easy exit payment methods and churn.

Other methods (mailed check, automatic transfers, credit card) are less represented among churners.

9. Financials
Churners pay higher average monthly charges (74.44) but have lower average total charges (1,532). This is consistent with shorter tenure (they leave sooner and accumulate less total). It could also suggest sensitivity to cost.
